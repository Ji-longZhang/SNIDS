# SNIDS
Smart Network-based Intrusion Detection System (SNIDS) is a software developed to detect attacks. SNIDS was developed during my master studies at the University of Manchester.

SNIDS uses WEKA API to run machine learning algorithms. Specifically, J48 classifier is used on HAN-let, and Vote meta-classifier is used combining SVM and RF classifiers on NAN-let. Both HAN-let and NAN-let are software components.
SNIDS was implemented in Java using Eclipse IDE. A GUI was also developed using WindowBuilder.
